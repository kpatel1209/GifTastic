Who doesn't love comedians?  Well I do.  This web application allows the user to click on the pre-exisiting buttons that holds popular comedian name.  The user will click on one of the buttons to display 10 gifs.  Clicking on the still image once will cause the gif to animate and clicking on them again will display the still image.

If the user wants to see gifs from a comedian not already listed, then they can add their favorite comedian by using the input box and clicking "Add Comedian".  This functon will then create a new button (alphabetically if the user capitalizes the first letter of the name) and can be clicked to display the new comedian's gifs.
